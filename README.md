# CalkaBot

CalkaBots are robots created by Jakub Kuziemski and Jakub Delicat. The first one CałkaBot 1.0 was made in 2018 for miniSUMO competition in UTP in Bydgoszcz. We were first grade students then, and we weren't experienced enough, so it was a huge surprise when we got to a semifinal group. The second one, CałkaBot 2.0, was made the following year and won a special prize in Bydgoszcz. We have been appreciated for the progress and for a PCB board project made by Deli. With both robots, improved to versions 1.1 and 2.1, we have gone to Baltic Robo Battles, to face up univeristy students. We weren't surprised when we have lost most of the battles, but CałkaBots were hard opponent many times. We have even managed to win some of the battles against students of technical universities.

# Hardware and software tips
To run STM32CubeProgrammer on linux it is nessesery to install java zulu

Ahh.. To run EAGLE on linux it is nessesery to copy library to $EAGLE/lib folder 
`sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb-dri3.so.0 lib/
